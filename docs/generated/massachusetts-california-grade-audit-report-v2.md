## Next actions

- [critical] district_or_county_education_routing: author_county_or_district_exact_targets
- [major] protection_and_advocacy: author_or_verify_statewide_source_family
- [major] parent_training_information_center: author_verified_state_manifest
- [major] legal_aid: author_or_verify_statewide_source_family
- [critical] county_local_disability_resources: author_county_or_district_exact_targets

## Completion decision

- Massachusetts remains UNSTARTED and not index-safe because one or more critical families are still legacy, inventory-only, or missing.
