# Utah California-Grade Audit Report v2

- classification: BLOCKED
- index_safe: false
- completeness_pct: 91
- county_count: 29

## Family status

- medicaid_state_health_coverage: verified_state_grade (statewide evidence is present at the required authority level)
- medicaid_waiver_hcbs_disability_services: verified_state_grade (statewide evidence is present at the required authority level)
- developmental_disability_idd_authority: verified_state_grade (statewide evidence is present at the required authority level)
- early_intervention_part_c: verified_state_grade (statewide evidence is present at the required authority level)
- special_education_idea_part_b: verified_state_grade (statewide evidence is present at the required authority level)
- district_or_county_education_routing: verified_current_official_district_lea_directory (the live Utah Schools Directory now clears district-grade education routing. The official page title is `Utah Schools Directory`, its description says the data is provided from the District or Local Education Agency (LEA) in the CACTUS system and directs corrections back to the District/LEA, the page exposes a District or LEA filter control, and it provides an export-to-CSV action on the current schools.utah.gov host.)
- vocational_rehabilitation_pre_ets: verified_state_grade (statewide evidence is present at the required authority level)
- protection_and_advocacy: verified_state_grade (reviewed first-party Disability Law Center evidence explicitly preserves Utah's Protection and Advocacy agency designation)
- parent_training_information_center: verified_state_grade (reviewed first-party Utah Parent Center PTI leaf explicitly preserves Parent Training and Information identity plus Utah contact evidence)
- legal_aid: verified_state_grade (reviewed first-party Disability Law Center evidence preserves statewide disability legal-rights help plus Apply for Help intake routing)
- able_program: verified_state_grade (statewide evidence is present at the required authority level)
- ssi_ssa_federal_reference: verified_state_grade (statewide evidence is present at the required authority level)
- county_local_disability_resources: legacy_state_grade (the older DWS services locations page now returns HTTP 500, the older DHHS locations route returns HTTP 404, and the live DHHS home only exposes a statewide office address with no county-grade office directory contract)

## Failure ledger

- county_local_disability_resources: dws_locations_500_and_dhhs_locations_404_leave_no_live_county_local_contract :: The older DWS services locations page returns HTTP 500, the older DHHS locations route returns HTTP 404, and the live DHHS home still lacks a county-grade office directory contract.

## Next actions

- [critical] county_local_disability_resources: hold_blocked_until_live_county_grade_utah_office_directory_or_county_owned_leaves_are_verified

## Completion decision

- Utah no longer lacks district-grade education routing evidence because the live Utah Schools Directory is an official district/LEA directory on the current USBE host.
- The page explicitly ties the dataset to District or Local Education Agency (LEA) submissions, exposes a District or LEA filter, and provides an export-to-CSV action.
- Utah still cannot reach California-grade or become index-safe because county/local disability resources still have no live county-grade office directory contract after the older DWS services locations page returned HTTP 500 and the older DHHS locations route returned HTTP 404.
- Utah therefore remains BLOCKED, not COMPLETE.
